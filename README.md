To understand and demonstrate the use of **tuples in Python**, including creation, indexing, repetition, immutability, built-in functions, unpacking, and comparison with lists.

* Creating tuples with different data types
* Accessing tuple elements using indexing (positive & negative)
* Tuple repetition using `*`
* Difference between tuple and list (immutability vs mutability)
* Using built-in functions on tuples (`max`, `min`, `sum`, `sorted`)
* Tuple packing and unpacking
* Counting elements in a tuple
* Creating tuples with different data types
* Accessing tuple elements using indexing (positive & negative)
* Tuple repetition using `*`
* Difference between tuple and list behavior (immutability vs mutability)
* Using built-in functions on tuples (`max`, `min`, `sum`, `sorted`)
* Tuple unpacking
* Counting elements in a tuple


This experiment contains multiple small Python programs demonstrating tuple operations:

1. Tuple Creation
   Creation of a tuple with mixed data types (integer, boolean, string).

2. ndexing in Tuples
   Accessing elements using positive and negative indexing.

3. Tuple Repetition
   Repeating tuple elements using the `*` operator.

4. Tuple vs List Repetition
   Demonstrates repetition in tuples and lists.

5. Tuple Immutability
   Shows how tuple modification creates a new object (change in `id`).

6. List Mutability
   Shows how list modification does not change object `id`.

7. Built-in Functions on Tuples
   Use of `max()`, `min()`, `sum()`, `sorted()` and average calculation.

8. Tuple Unpacking
   Assigning tuple values to multiple variables.

9. Conditional Logic with Tuples
   Checking marks and printing result based on condition.

10. Counting Elements
    Counting occurrences of elements using `count()` method.


Difference Between List and Tuple

 Feature          List                         Tuple                        
----------  | ---------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
Syntax      | `[ ]`                        | `( )`                         |
Mutability  | Mutable (can be changed)     | Immutable (cannot be changed) |
 Speed      | Slower                       | Faster                        |
 Memory     | Uses more memory             | Uses less memory              |
 Methods    | Many built-in methods        | Limited methods               |
 Use Case   | When data needs modification | When data should not change   |



 Algorithm for Tuple Packing

Step 1: Start the program
Step 2: Declare multiple values separated by commas
Step 3: Assign them to a single variable
Step 4: Python automatically packs the values into a tuple
Step 5: Display the packed tuple
Step 6: Stop

 Algorithm for Tuple Unpacking

Step 1: Start the program
Step 2: Create a tuple with multiple elements
Step 3: Declare the same number of variables as tuple elements
Step 4:Assign the tuple to these variables
Step 5: Python unpacks tuple elements into variables
Step 6: Display the unpacked values
Step 7: Stop



Conclusion

This experiment helps in understanding how tuples work in Python, their immutability, and how they differ from lists. It also demonstrates practical applications of tuples in data handling.
